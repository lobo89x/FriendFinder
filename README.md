# FriendFinder

In this activity, I was asked to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from client post/request, then compares data the data on the server. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I was tasked to use Express to handle routing making sure to deploy my app to Heroku to make it viable.
